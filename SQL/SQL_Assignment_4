1. What is index; types of indices; pros and cons
--Index: a.One of the best ways to reduce disk I/O is to use an index. b.Allows SQL Server to find data in a table without scanning the entire table
--Type of Indexex: Clustered Index and Non Clustered Index.
--pros and cons: An Index is a quick lookup table that is used to find a record that user search very frequently. An index helps to speed up select queries and where clauses, but it slows down data input, with the update and the insert statements.


2. What's the difference between Primary key and Unique constraint?
--PRIMARY KEY constraints identify the column or set of columns that have values that uniquely identify a row
in a table
--UNIQUE constraints enforce the uniqueness of the values in a set of columns.


3. Tell me about check constraint
--The CHECK constraint is used to limit the value range that can be placed in a column.

4. Difference between temp table and table variable
--Temp tables are physically created in the tempdb database. These tables act as the normal table and also can have constraints, index like normal tables.
--Table variable acts like a variable and exists for a particular batch of query execution. It gets dropped once it comes out of batch.

--5. Difference between WHERE and HAVING
--WHERE clause is used to specify a condition for filtering records before any groupings are made.
--HAVING clause is used to specify a condition for filtering values from a group.


--6. Difference between RANK() and DenseRank() â€” value gap
--RANK will then skip the next available ranking value. 
--DENSE_RANK would still use the next chronological ranking value, and it never gives any gaps..


--7. COUNT(*) vs. COUNT(colName)
--COUNT(*) returns all rows whether column contains null value or not. 
--COUNT(colName) returns the number of rows except null rows.


--8. What's the difference between left join and inner join? JOIN and Subquery, which one has a better performance, why?
--The result set of a left join includes all the rows from the left table specified in the LEFT OUTER clause. Inner Join just the ones in which the joined columns match.
-- JOIN has a better perfomance which executes better and has a faster retrieval time of the query. By using joins, users can maximize the calculation burden on the database i.e., instead of multiple queries using one join query.

--9. What is correlated subquery
--In a SQL database query, a correlated subquery (also known as a synchronized subquery) is a subquery (a query nested inside another query) that uses values from the outer query. Because the subquery may be evaluated once for each row processed by the outer query, it can be inefficient.


--10. What is a CTE, why do we need CTE?
--CTE specifies a temporary named result set.
We need CTE, because CTE improves readability and manageability of complex SQL Statements.


11. What does SQL Profiler do?
--SQL Server Profiler is an interface to create and manage traces and analyze and replay trace results.

12. What is SQL injection, how to avoid SQL injection?
--SQL injection is a code injection technique that might destroy your database.
--The only sure way to rrevent SQL Injection attacks is input validation and parametrized queries including prepared statements.


13. Difference between SP and user defined function? When to use SP when to use function?
--The user defined function only allows select statements to be read while DML statements are not allowed. On the other hand, stored procedure allows use of both select statements, as well as the DML statements, which can also be updated and manipulated.
--SPs can change database objects. Inline User-Defined Functions can be treated like views with parameters and can be used in row set operations and JOINs.


14. Criteria of Union and Union all? Difference between UNION and UNION ALL
--Unions concatenates the results of two queries into a single result set.
--Union removes duplicate records (where all columns in the results are the same), Union All does not.
--There is a performance hit when using Union vs Union All, since the database server must do additional work to remove the duplicate rows, but usually you do not want the duplicates especially in reports.
--The condition of using Unions are that the number of columns and data type of each column from both result set should match in the order they are given.
--Union & Union All are called set operators. There are two other types of SET Operators known as Intersect and Except. As the name suggests, they only return intersecting values and values that do not match respectively.


15. Steps you take to improve SQL Queries
--Define business requirements first. ...
--SELECT fields instead of using SELECT * ...
--Avoid SELECT DISTINCT. ...
--Create joins with INNER JOIN (not WHERE) ...
--Use WHERE instead of HAVING to define filters. ...
--Use wildcards at the end of a phrase only. ...
--Use LIMIT to sample query results.


16. concurrency problem in transaction
--The lost update concurrency problem occurs when no isolation is provided to a transaction from other transactions. This means that several transactions can read the same data and modify it. The changes to the data by all transactions, except those by the last transaction, are lost.


17. what is deadlock, how to prevent
--A deadlock occurs when two or more processes lock the separate resource.
--The ways to prevent deadlock are a.Try to keep transactions short; this will avoid holding locks in a transaction for a long period of time.
b. Access objects in a similar logical manner in multiple transactions.
c. Create a covering index to reduce the possibility of a deadlock.

18. what is normalization, 1NF - BCNF, benefits using normalization
--1NF is A table is referred to as being in its First Normal Form if atomicity of the table is 1.
--The first condition for the table to be in Second Normal Form is that the table has to be in First Normal Form. The table should not possess partial dependency. The partial dependency here means the proper subset of the candidate key should give a non-prime attribute.
--The first condition for the table to be in Third Normal Form is that the table should be in the Second Normal Form.
--Normalization organizes the columns and tables of a database to ensure that database integrity constraints properly execute their dependencies. It is a systematic technique of decomposing tables to eliminate data redundancy (repetition) and undesirable characteristics like Insertion, Update, and Deletion anomalies.


19. what are the system defined databases?
--There are 4 system defined database: master,model,msdb,tempdb.


20. composite key
--A composite key in SQL can be defined as a combination of multiple columns, and these columns are used to identify all the rows that are involved uniquely

21. candidate key
--Candidate key is a single key or a group of multiple keys that uniquely identify rows in a table.
--Create a candidate key with declare a column as a candidate key by using the keyword UNIQUE . Precede the UNIQUE keyword with the NOT NULL specification.

22. DDL vs. DML
--DDL is Data Definition Language which is used to define data structures. For example: create table, alter table are instructions in SQL. 
--DML is Data Manipulation Language which is used to manipulate data itself.


23. ACID property
--The ACID properties define SQL database key properties to ensure consistent, safe and robust database modification when saved. ACID is an acronym that helps to remember the fundamental principles of a transnational system. ACID stands for Atomic, Consistent, Isolation, and Durability.

24. table scan vs. index scan
-Table scan means iterate over all table rows. Index scan means iterate over all index items.

25. Difference between Union and JOIN
--Join: Joins the table based on certain conditions.
--Union will also check for duplicate. The data types should be consistent. The data types of columns returned should be in same order and number as the datatype and no. of columns returned by second table.
